# DestCert Junior Software Engineer Coding Assignment

Welcome to your coding assignment! This task is designed to assess your skills in full-stack development, focusing on Angular for the frontend and Next.js with Prisma for the backend. Let's get started!

## Overview

Your assignment is to create a simple To-Do application with a frontend powered by Angular and a backend using Next.js and Prisma. The project is divided into two main folders: `frontend` and `backend`.

You are expected to download or clone this project, create your own private git repo and add matheus@destcert.com as a member. 

### Frontend

- The `frontend` folder contains a starter application built with Angular.
- Your task is to develop the user interface for the To-Do application.
- The frontend should handle:
  - Adding To-Do items
  - Removing To-Do items
  - Marking To-Do items as complete
  - Searching through To-Do items

### Backend

- The `backend` folder includes a starter application with Next.js.
- You are expected to set up the logic for handling To-Do operations in the backend and integrating Prisma for the database communication.
- Use Next.js exclusively for the backend. Do not use it for frontend development.
- Use the API route provided in `src/app/api/hello/route.ts` as a starting point example for creating your own API.
- Be mindful of Restful operations. Use GET/POST/PUT/DELETE methods accordingly for handling CRUD and other operations.

## Database Setup

- Sign up for a free account at [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/). or research another free MySQL database provider.
- Create a MySQL database on PlanetScale.
- Integrate the database with your Next.js backend using Prisma.
- You will find documentation on integrating PlanetScale, Prisma, and Next.js, which you should research and follow.

## Requirements

- All business logic should reside in the backend and database. The frontend should only make calls to the backend endpoints for data manipulation.
- Extra points will be awarded for:
  - Implementing nice animations and design (nothing too fancy required).
  - Adding a simple authentication system (any method is acceptable, even basic ones).

## Submission

- Fork this repository and commit your code to your fork.
- Once completed, send an email with the link to your repository to matheus@destcert.com.
- Add `matheus@destcert.com` as a collaborator to your repository.
- This test should not take more than a day's work. If you have any doubts or questions, please don't hesitate to email me.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code quality and best practices
- Correct implementation of the requirements
- Creativity and efficiency in problem-solving
- Quality of the frontend design and user experience

We are excited to see what you will build and wish you the best of luck with this assignment!

Happy coding!
